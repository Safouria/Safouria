<b>Technologies Used</b>
React.js: The front-end framework used to build the user interface.
React Router: For navigating between different pages (e.g., search results, movie details).
TMDb API: Used to fetch movie and series data.
CSS: For styling and making the website responsive.
JavaScript: The language used for application logic and state management.
React Hooks: Utilizes useState, useEffect, useRef, and useNavigate for managing state, side effects, and navigation.
React Hooks Used
useState
I use the useState hook to manage local state throughout the app. Some examples include:

Managing the list of movies/TV shows (movies, tvShows).

Once the app is running:
Clicking on a movie or TV series will take you to a detailed page showing more information about it.
You can view posters, descriptions, reviews and release dates for each item.
