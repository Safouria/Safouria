<b>Technologies Used</b><hr/>
React.js: The front-end framework used to build the user interface.<hr/>
React Router: For navigating between different pages (e.g., search results, movie details).<hr/>
TMDb API: Used to fetch movie and series data.<hr/>
CSS: For styling and making the website responsive.<hr/>
JavaScript: The language used for application logic and state management.<hr/>
React Hooks: Utilizes useState, useEffect, useRef, and useNavigate for managing state, side effects, and navigation.<hr/><hr/>
<b>React Hooks Used</b>
useState<hr/>
I use the useState hook to manage local state throughout the app. Some examples include:<hr/>

Managing the list of movies/TV shows (movies, tvShows).<hr/>

<b>Once the app is running:<b/><hr/>
Clicking on a movie or TV series will take you to a detailed page showing more information about it.<hr/>
You can view posters, descriptions, reviews and release dates for each item.
